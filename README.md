# Angular APT
Angular APT is a web API for [APT](http://github.com/cvo-theory/apt), a powerful software for petri net analysis and synthesis developed at the Carl von Ossietzly University in Oldenburg, Germany.

For easy integration into AngularJS apps, an AngularJS module is provided.

Its build to work with [APO](http://github.com/stromhalm/apo) but should work well with any other web application as well.
